# Alfido-Tech-3 (Weather Data Analysis)
In this project we conduct data analysis and visualization using a famous data analysis and visualisation on Weather data using library called Pandas. Here is a quick summary of what will be covered in this tutorial:

installation of Python packages (requests, pandas, jupyter)
weather data collection (using the Tomorrow.io weather API)
data analysis (mean, min, max, std, etc.)
data visualization (bar plot, pie chart)
